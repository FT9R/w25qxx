A simple library designed to perform basic write/read operations with serial flash memory devices of the w25qxx family.
Data transfer is carried out by standard SPI instructions using the CLK, /CS, DI, DO pins.
## Conditions
`Target MCU - STM32F407VGT6 (STM32F4XX_M devBoard)`  
`Toolchain - IAR EWARM v9.20.1`
## Supported devices
* w25q80
* w25q16
* w25q32
* w25q64
* w25q128
## Quick start
Burn it into MCU and debug through terminal I/O
